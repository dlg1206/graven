Graven uses an Apache 2.0 license to encourage free and open-source use for
security research. In an industry setting, data is valuable and this tooling could potentially be 
monopolized by companies with more resources than independent developers.
The Apache 2.0 license allows users and contributors a license to any relevant 
patent independently of these companies. However, this is not to discourage
industry adoption, rather a safeguard to ensure the broader security 
community still can provide contributions and integration in the interest of the entire community. 
Lastly, the license ensures proper attribution to contributors to the project to recognize the 
value of their contributions.
